## notes about text editors

# sublime-text-2
A sublime text 2 implementation of TSEpro

I've been coding with TSEpro for over 20 years. I love it. But it did not move to linux, and is not able of 
managing text encoding. So I choose Sublime Text 2 as a basic editor. It's full featured.

I am trying my old TSEpro macros on ST2. This is my contribution. Hope you find it useful, even if you don't come from 
TSEpro

Regards,
Daniel
